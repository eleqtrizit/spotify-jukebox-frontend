# Spotify Jukebox - Frontend

## Why?

With the goal of learning [React](https://reactjs.org/), I needed an interesting project. I made this Spotify-based Jukebox.

## Spotify already offers Group Sessions

Group Sessions are limited to Spotify Premium users only. Spotify Jukebox only requires _one_ Premium user, belonging to the "party starter". It also doesn't require the installation of Spotify on any device except one. The jukebox is updated via browser.

## How to use

The Spotify Premium user logs into the [Spotify Jukebox](https://jukebox.rivera-web.com) and starts a party. From there, the Premium user can share the link via SMS, iMessage, etc. You can also pull up the QR Code and have someone near you just scan in with their camera.

You can see the playlist created inside the Premium user's Spotify, named something like **Jukebox_f3e43w3**. The Premium user just needs to hook a Spotify-installed device to some speakers and press play.

## UI

The UI is optimized for small screens, as that is the most likely use-case (unless you're at a [LAN Party](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=lan+party&first=1&cw=1389&ch=943&tsc=ImageHoverTitle), I guess). It displays OK on a regular screen, too.
